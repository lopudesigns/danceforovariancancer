				<h2>Carolyn Glover</h2>
				<p  id="one">My name is Carolyn Glover and it is so exciting to be working on our second event to raise much needed funds for ovarian cancer research. It was in early 2014 that my  friend Millicent came up with the idea of a dance-related event to support me, and women like me, who are having to deal with the challenge of ovarian cancer. The idea of the Dance-‘O’-Thon was born because I love to dance – though poorly I might add!
					<br><br>
				I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer over four years ago. Though I am currently under treatment, I am happy to say I am well and active thanks to the excellent oncologists and medical infrastructure we have here in Melbourne.
				<br><br>
				Our last Dance-O-Thon raised $32,000+ towards the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS). So join us in May 2016 to make the event even bigger and better than last time...
				<br><br>
				<ul class="aboutul">
				<li>Come to raise more funds for ovarian cancer research</li>
				<li>Come if you have ovarian cancer, or wish to support someone who does</li>
				<li>Come if you wish to know more about the disease</li>
				<li>Come to celebrate life!</li>

				<p class="" id="one">Hello fellow dancers!
					<br><br>
All of us at Ovarian Cancer Australia are so excited to strap on our dancing shoes for the Dance-O-Thon in 2016 and we hope you are too!
<br><br>
I’d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in organising the Dance-O-Thon for all of the hard work, time and effort that goes into putting on such a fantastic event. We are so grateful for the support of your community.
<br><br>
Thank you also to everyone who will be fundraising for us at the Dance-O-Thon. These much-needed funds will go towards supporting the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study, a collaborative research program between clinicians, scientists, patients and advocacy groups aimed at improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. Together, we can save lives and ensure no woman with ovarian cancer walks alone.
<br><br>
See you on the dance-floor on the 14th May!

				<br><br> Registration costs $35 for adults, $25 for students, $15 for under 16s or an $80 family ticket for two adults and two under 16s

				<p class="desc">To set up a sponsorship page <a href="https://ovariancancer.secure.force.com/CICD__SignUp?id=70116000000oakU">here</a> 
				
				<br><br>Pick a team name and set yourself a fundraising goal. There will be prizes for the top team and individual fundraisers. Don’t forget to share your sponsorship page on Facebook, Twitter, via email or in person and watch the sponsorship money roll in. You can collect money either online or in cash. 
</p>

				<h1>Get a team</h1>
				<p class="desc">Badger your friends and grab a team of up to 8 people to tackle the challenge with. It doesn’t matter if they are dance masters or wouldn’t usually be seen dead on the dance floor. If you prefer you can choose to dance as an individual.<br><br>
The idea is that at least one member of each team is dancing at all times for the full 8 hours. 8 hours is the goal but you’re welcome to set your own goal if that isn’t possible. You just won’t be eligible for the competitor prize draw at the end.<br><br>
You can add team members to your team at any time by having them sign up using the team captain’s sponsorship link.

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">What does the event involve?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">The event involves registered teams (up to 8 dancers) dancing relay‐style for an 8‐hour duration and seeking sponsorship from friends, family and work colleagues for their efforts. 8 hours is just a goal, it’s up to you how long you want to dance. But with the amazing line-up of fun (and almost famous) bands, dance instructors and DJs you probably won’t want to stop. Even if you have to collapse once 8 hours is up. As an added incentive to keep dancing, prizes will be awarded throughout the day for all your hard work.
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Where is the event?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">The Dance-o-thon will be held in the Grand Hall of the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kingston+City+Hall/@-37.93378,144.9659392,12z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1skingston+city+hall!3m1!1s0x6ad66eb237f62e3f:0xc9e49003d9d323c1">Kingston City Hall</a>, 979-985 Nepean Hwy, Moorabbin near the corner of South Road and Nepean Hwy. The Grand Hall is on the second floor. 
</p>

							<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Do I need a team to dance?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">You don’t need a team to participate. You can set your own personal challenge of endurance and dance for as long as you can.
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Who can dance?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">We welcome dancers of any age. Children under 12 have to be accompanied by an adult.  
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Where does the money go?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">100% of the sponsorship money and a portion of the registration fees will go to Ovarian Cancer Australia (OCA) for vital research to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Ovarian Cancer. </p>

			<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">How much does it cost?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">There is a registration fee of $35 for adults, $25 for students, $15 for those 16 and under and $80 for a family ticket (two adults and two children). The registration fee covers the cost of running the event including venue hire and insurance but any remaining proceeds will all go to Ovarian Cancer Australia.

<br>
<br>With your registration fee you will also receive:
<ul> 
<li>8 hours of music, entertainment and dance instruction</li>
<li>A ‘survival kit’ which includes sandwiches, snacks and water.</li>
</ul>

</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">How do I collect sponsorships?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">All dancers are encouraged to seek sponsorships for their efforts. 8 hours of dancing is not easy and you should be rewarded for your efforts. More importantly 100% of sponsorship money will go to Ovarian Cancer Australia towards ground-breaking research to improve the treatment and lives of women suffering from this disease. 
<br><br>
Set up your sponsorship page <a href="https://ovariancancer.secure.force.com/CICD__SignUp?id=70116000000oakU">here</a> to start collecting money online. Or if you prefer you can collect cash donations and bring them on the day. 
</p>

			<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Are donations and sponsorships tax-deductible?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">Yes, donations and sponsorships over $2 are tax-deductible however the registration fee is not. For all online sponsorships a receipt will be sent automatically after the transaction. All donations over $2 by cheque or cash will receive a receipt from OCA after the event</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Will there be food and drinks available?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">A survival kit with sandwiches, snacks and water will be provided with your registration. A kiosk will be open to purchase additional snacks and drinks throughout the event and you are welcome to bring your own food to keep you going. 
					<br><br>

There will be water on tap to fill up your drink bottles

</p>

			<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Can I drink alcohol?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">This is an alcohol-free event. We want you to remember everyone’s terrible dance moves in all their glory.
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">How else can I get involved or support the event?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">The event organisers are largely volunteers so any help you may be able to provide us would be greatly appreciated, even if you can’t make it on the day. Please send us an email <a href="mailto:emma.robinson@ovariancancer.net.au">here</a> if you wish to volunteer or have some product or service that you may be able to donate.
