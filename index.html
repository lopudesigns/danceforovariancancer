<!-- 				<h1 class="wantto">Registering?</h1>  -->
				
				<!-- <p id="steps">Step 1</p> -->
				<h1>Get a team</h1>
				<p id="desc">Grab a team of up to 8 people to tackle the challenge with. Badger your friends, even if they hate dancing, especially if they hate dancing, or register as a solo dancer now and team members can join later. 
The idea is that at least one member of each team is dancing at all times for the full 8 hours. 8 hours is the goal but if you’re welcome to set your own goal if that isn’t possible. You just won’t be eligible for the competitor prize draw at the end.
</p>

				<!-- <p id="steps">Step 2</p> -->
				<h1>Pick a team name</h1>
				<p id="desc">Pick a team name that all your team members can sign up under. Get creative!
</p>

				<!-- <p id="steps">Step 3</p> -->
				<h1>Register</h1>
				<p id="desc">You can register <a href="https://ovariancancer.secure.force.com/eventTicket?e=70116000000ob0m">here</a>. Each team member needs to sign up individually and list their team name on the form.  
Registration costs $30 for adults and $20 for under 16s. Want to know what your registration fee pays for? Check out our FAQs (link).

</p>

				<!-- <p id="steps">Step 4</p> -->
				<h1>Get sponsored</h1>
				<p id="desc">Set up a team sponsorship page <a href="https://ovariancancer.secure.force.com/CICD__SignUp?id=70116000000oakU">here</a> and set yourself a fundraising goal. There will be prizes for the top team and individual fundraisers. Don’t forget to share your sponsorship page on Facebook, Twitter, via email or in person if you remember how to do that, and watch the sponsorship money roll in.

			<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
				<h2 id="faqtitle">FAQ</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">What does the event involve?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">The event involves registered teams (up to 8 dancers) dancing relay‐style for an 8‐hour duration and seeking sponsorship from friends, family and work colleagues for their efforts. 8 hours is just a goal, it’s up to you how long you want to dance. But with the amazing line-up of fun (and almost famous) bands, dance instructors and DJs you probably won’t want to stop. Even if you have to collapse once 8 hours is up. As an added incentive to keep dancing, prizes will be awarded throughout the day for all your hard work.
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Where is the event?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">The Dance-o-thon will be held in the Grand Hall of the Kingston City Hall, 979-985 Nepean Hwy, Moorabbin near the corner of South Road and Nepean Hwy. The Grand Hall is on the second floor. [if you could link to google maps with the address loaded that would be great]
</p>

							<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Do I need a team to dance?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">You don’t need a team to participate. You can set your own personal challenge of endurance and dance for as long as you can.
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Who can dance?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">We welcome dancers of any age. Children under 12 have to be accompanied by an adult however and parental consent is needed for under 18s. 
</p>

			<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">What if I want to come but I can only come for a short while or don’t want to dance?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">You are more than welcome to come even only for a short time or not to dance. Casual dancers and spectators can participate in the events by paying a small entrance fee at the door (proceeds collected on the day will be donated to OCA). 
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Where does the money go?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">100% of the sponsorship money and a portion of the registration fees will go to Ovarian Cancer Australia (OCA) for vital research to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Ovarian Cancer. </p>

			<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">How much does it cost?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">There is a registration fee of $30 for adults and $20 for under 16s. The registration fee covers the cost of running the event including venue hire and insurance but any remaining proceeds will all go to Ovarian Cancer Australia. You can register [here]

<br>
<br>With your registration fee you will also receive:
<ul> 
<li>8 hours of music and dance instruction</li>
<li>A ‘survival kit’ which includes a light meal, snacks, water etc.</li>
</ul>

</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">How do I collect sponsorships?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">All dancers are encouraged to seek sponsorships for their efforts. 8 hours of dancing is not easy and you should be rewarded for your efforts. More importantly 100% of sponsorship money will go to Ovarian Cancer Australia towards ground-breaking research to improve the treatment and lives of women suffering from this disease. 

Set up your sponsorship page [here] and start collecting money!
</p>

			<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Are donations and sponsorships tax-deductible?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">Yes, donations and sponsorships over $2 are tax-deductible however the registration fee is not. For all online sponsorships a receipt will be sent automatically after the transaction. All donations over $2 by cheque or cash will receive a receipt from OCA after the event</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Will there be food and drinks available?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">A survival kit with a light meal, snacks and water will be provided with your registration, a kiosk will be open to purchase additional snacks and drinks throughout the event. 

There will be water on tap to fill up your drink bottles

</p>

			<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">Can I drink alcohol?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">This is an alcohol-free event. We want you to remember everyone’s terrible dance moves in all their glory.
</p>

				<h1 id="question"><span class="h1bg">How else can I get involved or support the event?</span></h1>
				<p id="answer">The event organisers are 100% volunteers so any help you may be able to provide us would be greatly appreciated, even if you can’t make it on the day. Please send us an email [here] if you wish to volunteer or have some product or service that you may be able to donate.
